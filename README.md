# maven_iuvs
maven_iuvs is the place where all cool cats and kittens go to contribute Python routines for IUVS science. :smiley_cat: :sunglasses: 

It provides:
* Tools for reading and manipulating IUVS data 
* Standardized projections of IUVS data
* Integration with spiceyPy
* ... and much much more

Documentation is hosted here: https://lasp.github.io/maven_iuvs/

If you want to contribute code, follow the instructions [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/dev/) to fork the repo to
your Github personal page and clone from there. Otherwise, you can just clone this repo directly.

Regardless of which option you choose, you can install the package with `pip install .` to make it available 
on your system.

# Contributions
We appreciate contributions from people of all backgrounds. Even if you do not plan to contribute code, raising issues
of bugs, unexpected behavior, and suggestions for improvement would all be valuable.
